The API allows fetching news from different categories such as general, entertainment, health, science, sports, and technology.
The application creates a dynamic UI where users can select different news categories.
When a category is selected, the application makes an API call to fetch news specific to that category.
The API request URL is constructed using the country code, selected category, and an API key.
The fetched news articles are then displayed on the page, showing the article title, description, image, and a "Read More" link to the full article.The API seems to provide various details for each article, including title, description, content, image URL, and the URL to the full article.
